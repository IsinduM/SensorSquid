An external data capture and transmission system designed to be fitted on top of a functional FSAE vehicle. Includes 16 ADC inputs for temperatures and other analog-based sensors, PWM timers for wheel-speed sensing, CAN to interface with the vehicle, SDIO to log to an external SD card, and USART to transmit wirelessly via serial radio modules.
